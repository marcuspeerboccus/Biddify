# 🚗 Biddify: Damaged Car Price Predictor  

**Biddify** is an in-progress application that leverages computer vision and machine learning to predict the final bid price of damaged vehicles at auction. The project utilizes advanced techniques like Qwen Vision Language Model (VLM), a hybrid KNN-CNN framework, and data mining tools to analyze vehicle images and metadata for accurate price predictions.  

## 🌐 Current Status  
The React frontend for **Biddify** is deployed and serves as the user interface. It allows users to:  
- Upload images of damaged vehicles.  
- Input relevant vehicle information.  

Backend integration and machine learning model deployment are currently in progress.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies  

### Frontend  
- **React** (Next.js with TypeScript)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)  
- **Node.js** (runtime environment)  
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)  

### Required Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following installed to run the project locally:  
1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)  
   - [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/)  
2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
3. **React** (via Next.js)  
   - Already included in the repository setup.

## 📂 Running the Frontend Locally

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcuspeerboccus/biddify.git
   cd biddify
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
3. ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
## 🖼️ What Does Biddify Do?
- **Image Analysis**: Extracts key features from damaged vehicle photos using Qwen Vision Language Model (VLM).
- **Price Prediction**: Implements a hybrid KNN-CNN framework to predict auction prices.
- **Data Mining**: Experiments with BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and browser automation to scrape historical sales data from Copart auctions.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Integrating backend services for processing uploaded images and vehicle information.
- Training and deploying the machine learning model for price prediction.
- Enhancing data extraction tools for auction data using web scraping.

## ✨ Features (Planned & In-Progress)
- **Upload Interface**: User-friendly interface for uploading images and metadata.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Predict final auction prices for damaged vehicles.
- **Data Mining**: Scrape and analyze historical auction data to improve predictions.
